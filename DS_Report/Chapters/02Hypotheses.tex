\section{Primary Research Questions}

Based on the theoretical foundations covered in the lectures, this submission addresses the following research questions:\\

\textbf{RQ1}: What are the characteristic distributions and relationships among chemical and sensory variables in Portuguese red and white wines?\\

\textbf{RQ2}: Do red and white wines exhibit significantly different alcohol content levels?\\

\textbf{RQ3}: Can wine quality be effectively predicted from chemical and sensory properties using linear regression techniques?\\

\textbf{RQ4}: How accurately can wines be classified into quality categories (good vs. bad) based on their chemical composition?\\

\textbf{RQ5}: Can wine variety (red vs. white) be predicted from chemical properties alone, and what is the predictive performance on validation data?\\

\textbf{RQ6}: What underlying factor structure exists in the chemical composition data, and how many factors are needed to adequately represent wine chemistry?\\

\section{Statistical Hypotheses}

\textbf{Hypothesis 1 (H1)}: Alcohol Content Comparison
\begin{itemize}
	\item $H_0$: $\mu_{\text{red}} = \mu_{\text{white}}$ (No difference in mean alcohol content between red and white wines)
	\item $H_1$: $\mu_{\text{red}} \neq \mu_{\text{white}}$ (Significant difference in mean alcohol content between wine types)
	\item $\alpha = 0.05$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hypothesis 2 (H2)}: Linear Regression Model Significance
\begin{itemize}
	\item $H_0$: $\beta_1 = \beta_2 = \ldots = \beta_k = 0$ (No linear relationship between chemical variables and wine quality)
	\item $H_1$: At least one $\beta_i \neq 0$ (Significant linear relationship exists)
	\item $\alpha = 0.05$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hypothesis 3 (H3)}: Classification Performance
\begin{itemize}
	\item $H_0$: Classification accuracy $\leq 0.5$ (No better than random chance)
	\item $H_1$: Classification accuracy $> 0.5$ (Better than random classification)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hypothesis 4 (H4)}: Factor Analysis Suitability
\begin{itemize}
	\item $H_0$: Correlation matrix is not suitable for factor analysis (KMO $< 0.5$)
	\item $H_1$: Correlation matrix is suitable for factor analysis (KMO $\geq 0.5$)
\end{itemize}
