This study analyzes a comprehensive dataset of 6,497 Portuguese wines using statistical methods taught in the Introduction to Data Science course. The research applies descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, regression modeling, classification algorithms, and factor analysis to understand relationships between chemical properties and wine characteristics. Key findings include significant differences in alcohol content between wine varieties, successful prediction models achieving 99.2\% accuracy for color classification, and identification of three underlying factor dimensions explaining 54.8\% of wine property variance.
