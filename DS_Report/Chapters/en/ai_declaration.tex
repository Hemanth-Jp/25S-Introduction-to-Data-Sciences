This assignment was completed with assistance from Claude (Anthropic) for structural planning, R code development, and analytical guidance. The AI tool was used specifically for:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Brainstorming:} Initial project structure and analytical approach
\item \textbf{Code Development:} R script creation and debugging assistance
\item \textbf{Literature Integration:} Connecting results to statistical theory
\item \textbf{Report Structure:} Academic formatting and presentation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Prompts used:} ``Help me analyze wine dataset for Introduction to Data Science assignment'', ``Create R script for statistical analysis of wine properties'', ``Interpret statistical results and create academic report''

All data analysis, statistical interpretation, and conclusions represent the authors' independent work based on the provided dataset and course materials.
