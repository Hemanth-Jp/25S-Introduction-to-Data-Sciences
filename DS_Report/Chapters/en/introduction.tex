\chapter{Introduction}

Wine quality assessment relies heavily on chemical analysis and sensory evaluation. This assignment systematically applies fundamental data science techniques to explore patterns in Portuguese wine data, addressing six specific research questions through statistical analysis using R programming. The dataset contains information on both red and white wines, providing an excellent opportunity to demonstrate various analytical approaches taught in class.

\textbf{Research Objectives:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Characterize the distribution of wine properties through descriptive statistics
\item Test for significant differences in alcohol content between red and white wines
\item Model quality prediction for red wines using multiple regression
\item Develop binary classification for wine quality assessment
\item Predict wine color from chemical properties using logistic regression
\item Identify underlying factor structure in wine characteristics
\end{enumerate}
