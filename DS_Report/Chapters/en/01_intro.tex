\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}

The wine industry represents a significant economic sector globally, with quality assessment serving as a critical factor in market positioning and consumer satisfaction. Traditional wine quality evaluation relies heavily on expert sensory analysis, which, while valuable, can be subjective and inconsistent. The advent of analytical chemistry and data science methodologies offers new opportunities to develop objective, reproducible approaches to wine quality assessment.

The Portuguese wine industry, with its rich viticultural heritage and diverse terroir, produces wines of varying characteristics and quality levels. Understanding the relationship between chemical composition and perceived quality can provide valuable insights for winemakers, quality control specialists, and researchers in enology.

This study leverages advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze a comprehensive dataset of Portuguese wines, examining both red and white varieties. By applying methods taught in the Introduction to Data Science course, including exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, classification techniques, and dimensionality reduction, we aim to uncover patterns and relationships that can inform wine production and quality assessment practices.

\section{Problem Definition}

The primary research problem addresses the predictability of wine quality based on physicochemical properties. Specifically, this study investigates:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Descriptive Analysis}: What are the characteristic chemical profiles of Portuguese red and white wines, and how do these distributions inform our understanding of wine composition?
	
	\item \textbf{Comparative Analysis}: Do red and white wines exhibit significantly different alcohol content levels, and what implications does this have for wine classification?
	
	\item \textbf{Predictive Modeling}: To what extent can wine quality be predicted from chemical and sensory variables, and which factors are most influential in determining quality ratings?
	
	\item \textbf{Classification Performance}: How effectively can wines be classified into quality categories (good vs. bad) and variety types (red vs. white) using chemical composition data?
	
	\item \textbf{Dimensionality Reduction}: Can the complex chemical profile of wines be reduced to a smaller set of underlying factors that capture the essential characteristics of wine composition?
\end{enumerate}

These research questions are addressed through the systematic application of statistical methods, ensuring both theoretical rigor and practical relevance to the wine industry.
